### Preview:

### Things I learned:

- Svelte's way of doing things (I like it)
- Using localStorage
- Using query params for API calls
- Dynamically changing SVG fill colors with theme variables
- Theme switching in Svelte
- API route functions/calls
- "static" folder (not sure I love this)
- Sometimes builds work locally, then break in production
- Svelte's `.env` setup

---

### Challenges I faced while building this:

1. Mostly syntax differences
2. Sending params to API route
3. Importing `CSS` theme files correctly using the static folder

### Things I'm proud of:

- I felt so comfortable using this framework even without having tons of experience with it
- It didn't take me nearly as long as it would have even 6 months ago
- I find myself understanding the concepts at the base of these frameworks better after using several
- Resisted the urge to over-complicate. Kept it simple start to finish.
- I figured out how to solve all my issues during this build even with the community being substantially smaller than React.
- I know beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but I think it's really pretty
