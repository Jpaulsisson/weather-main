### Things I learned:

- Svelte's way of doing things (I like it)
- Using localStorage
- Using query params for API calls
- Dynamically changing SVG fill colors with theme variables
- Theme switching in Svelte
- API route functions/calls
- "static" folder (not sure I love this)
- Sometimes builds work locally, then break in production
- Svelte's `.env` setup

---

### Challenges I faced while building this:

1. Mostly syntax differences
2. Sending params to API route
3. Importing `CSS` theme files correctly using the static folder

### Things I'm proud of:

- I recreated the site from scratch in one day after accidentally deleting it
- All but mastering the tailwind framework
- I didn't let the things I couldn't figure out, right away, make me discouraged
- I completed this in a very reasonable amount of time, even taking time to make multiple drafts
- I feel like this will represent me well without being too stiff
- My family getting to be on something I've built
